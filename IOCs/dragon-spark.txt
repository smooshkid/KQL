Malware staging infrastructure
  11.149.237[.]108	- China	A compromised server hosting web content related to gambling.
  43.129.227[.]159	- Hong Kong	A Windows Server 2012 R2 instance with a computer name of 172_19_0_3. The threat actors may have obtained access to this server using a shared or bought account. We observed login credentials with the server’s name being shared over different time periods in the Telegram channels King of VP$ and SellerVPS for sharing and/or selling access to virtual private servers.
  www[.]bingoplanet[.]com[.]tw	- Taiwan	A compromised server hosting web content related to gambling. The website resources have been removed at the time of writing. The domain has been co-hosted with several other websites of legitimate business, including travel agencies and an English preschool.
  www[.]moongallery.com[.]tw	- Taiwan	A compromised server hosting the website of the Taiwanese art gallery Moon Gallery.
  www[.]holybaby.com[.]tw	- Taiwan	A compromised server hosting the website of the Taiwanese baby product shop retailer Holy Baby.

C2 server infrastructure
  103.96.74[.]148	Hong Kong	A Windows Server 2012 R2 instance with a computer name of CLOUD2012R2.
    The threat actors may have obtained access to this server using a shared or bought account. We observed login credentials with the server’s name being shared over different time periods in the Telegram channels Premium Acc, IRANHACKERS, and !Only For Voters for sharing and/or selling access to virtual private servers.
    This set of infrastructure was observed resolving to jiance.ittoken[.]xyz at the time of writing. This specific domain can be linked to a wider set of Chinese phishing infrastructure over the past few years. It is unclear if they are related to this same actor.
  104.233.163[.]190	United States	A Windows Server 2012 R2 instance with a computer name of WIN-CLC0OFDKTMK.
    The most recent passive DNS record related to this IP address points to a domain name with a Chinese TLD – kanmn[.]cn. However, this is shared hosting infrastructure through Aquanx and likely used by a variety of customers.
    This IP address is known to have hosted a Cobalt Strike C2 server and been involved in other malicious activities, such as hosting known malware samples.
